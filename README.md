# Analyzing Socio-Demographic Factors Influencing High School Performance

This project utilizes the **High School Student Performance & Demographics**  dataset provided by [Dillon Myrick on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/high-school-student-performance-and-demographics) to analyze factors influencing academic performance. It aims to uncover patterns in student behavior, demographics, and grades.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains performance and demographic data from two Portuguese high schools. The dataset provides information on performance in two distinct subjects, Mathematics and Portuguese language. It includes features such as:
- Student grades (first period, second period, final grade).
- Demographic attributes (age, sex, address type, etc.).
- Social and family-related features (parent education, study time, support, etc.).

This data is valuable for understanding the key factors affecting student performance and improving educational strategies.
